This project contains content in html, css and javascript format. The file will have to be downloaded with all contents and then put into a separate folder. Download the files, then make a new folder anywhere on your laptop or computer and then drag and move the downloaded files to that folder. You will need a web browser to run the project. Index.html is what will run the project.

I chose the general license v3.0 because it gives the user the knowledge this project has an official license and the rules that the user will have to follow to modify the content safely.
