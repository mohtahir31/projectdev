This project contains content in html, css and javascript format. The file will have to be downloaded with all contents and then put into a separate folder. Download the files, then make a new folder anywhere on your laptop or computer and then drag and move the downloaded files to that folder. You will need a web browser to run the project. Index.html is what will run the project. The other 2 files are source code for the game to work properly. 

This project is a javascript game that contains a story about a person walking in a jungle and ecounters a pathway which can lead them to the end of the jungle or death in it. Play to find out which option reaches you to the end of the game with sucsess or failure.
